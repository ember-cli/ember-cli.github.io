Ember CLI is the official command line utility used to create, build, serve, 
and test [Ember.js](https://emberjs.com) apps and addons.

It provides a consistent project structure, a powerful [addon
system](/extending/#developing-addons-and-blueprints), and
a fast [Broccoli](https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli#broccoli)-powered
build pipeline.
Whether you are looking for a zero-config experience or the ability to make your own customizations, Ember CLI has the tools you need.

There are thousands of JavaScript libraries made specifically for Ember.
We call them addons.
Ember CLI’s [addon system](/extending/#developing-addons-and-blueprints)
provides a way to create reusable units of code, share components and styling, 
extend the build tooling, and more &mdash; all with a minimal configuration.
To view a complete list of addons, visit 
[EmberObserver](https://www.emberobserver.com/).
You can still use your favorite npm packages directly too.
If they are not available as addons yet, you can add them into your asset 
pipeline or create your own addon wrappers.

Ember CLI's [asset compilation system](/user-guide/#asset-compilation) has out-of-the-box support for:

* [LESS](http://lesscss.org/)
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
* [Compass](http://compass-style.org/)
* [EmberScript](http://emberscript.com/)
* [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/)
* Minified JS & CSS

### Modules

Ember CLI uses [babel](https://babeljs.io/),
which turns [ES2015 module syntax](http://jsmodules.io/)
into AMD (RequireJS-esq) modules.

Using a custom resolver, Ember CLI can automatically import modules when
needed. For example, the route in `routes/post.js` will know to use the
controller in `controllers/post.js` and the template in `templates/post.hbs`.
You are not limited to automatic resolution so if your application needs to
explicitly include a module, it's only an `import` away. Learn more about
[ES2015 modules here](http://jsmodules.io/).

### Testing using the CLI

All apps built with Ember CLI are preconfigured to use
[QUnit](https://qunitjs.com/) and [Ember
QUnit](https://github.com/rwjblue/ember-qunit). While these are the default,
you are free to use other options such as [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and
[Ember Mocha](https://github.com/switchfly/ember-cli-mocha/).

### Dependency Management

Ember CLI supports both [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and
[npm](https://npmjs.org) for managing dependencies.

### Runtime Configuration

Ember CLI's runtime is configurable via a file named `.ember-cli`.  The
JSON-formatted file, which must be placed in your home directory, can include
any command-line options whose names must be in camel case form. For example:

{% highlight bash %}
# ~/.ember-cli
{
  "skipGit" : true,
  "port" : 999,
  "host" : "0.1.0.1",
  "liveReload" : true,
  "environment" : "mock-development",
  "checkForUpdates" : false
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Content Security Policy

The [ember-cli-content-security-policy](https://github.com/rwjblue/ember-cli-content-security-policy/)
addon can be used to to enable the [Content Security Policy](https://content-security-policy.com/) 
headers in modern browsers when running the development server.

When enabled, Content Security Policy headers help mitigate certain types of
attacks including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection.
[Browser support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=contentsecuritypolicy) is very good, 
and the `ember-cli-content-security-policy` addon makes it easy to build your
app with CSP in mind. For example, enabling it on your production stack is
a matter of [adding headers](/user-guide/#content-security-policy). 

### Community
